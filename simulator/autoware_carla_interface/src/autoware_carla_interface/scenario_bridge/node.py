"""ROS 2 node: drive Autoware's startup from a scenario mission and report readiness.

This is the Autoware side of the CARLA scenario contract (the remote gRPC service
is named ``AutowareBridge``; this node is its client).  It owns the whole startup
sequence and exposes only a single readiness flag back to the scenario runner:

1. poll ``GetMission`` until the scenario hands over an initial pose + goal;
2. initialize localization at the initial pose (``/api/localization/initialize``) --
   skipped when ``initialize_localization`` is False (ground-truth / E2E stacks);
3. set the route to the goal (``/api/routing/set_route_points``), but only once
   localization has reached INITIALIZED (the mission planner starts the route from
   the current odometry pose and rejects requests before that);
4. once localization is satisfied, the route is SET, and autonomous mode is
   available, engage once (``/api/operation_mode/change_to_autonomous``), gated
   behind ``auto_engage`` (scenario/sim only);
5. aggregate localization/routing/operation-mode state into a single readiness
   flag and push it back with ``ReportReadiness``.  ``require_localization_initialized``
   controls whether localization is part of "ready".

The startup runs as an **idempotent reconciliation loop**: a periodic tick (and
every AD API state change) re-drives whichever step is still outstanding, so a
step that cannot complete yet -- the AD API services are not up, the mission
planner is not ready, or a gRPC call fails transiently -- is retried on the next
pass instead of being silently dropped.  The tick keeps running until readiness
has been reported.

This replaces the manual ``ros2 service call`` goal + engage flow (e.g.
``run_odaiba_outbound.sh``) with a scenario-driven one.

High-bandwidth data (sensors, control, ``/clock``, tf) never flows over the
bridge; it stays on ROS 2 topics and direct CARLA control in the interface node.
