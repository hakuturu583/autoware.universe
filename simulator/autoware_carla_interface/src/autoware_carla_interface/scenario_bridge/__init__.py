"""Autoware side of the CARLA scenario ``AutowareBridge``.

Topology: the scenario runner hosts the ``AutowareBridge`` gRPC server and the
``scenario_bridge`` node (see :mod:`.node`) is the client that dials it.  The
runner process itself is launched separately -- ROS 2 launch runs the
``scenario_runner`` executable (see :mod:`.venv_manager`), which provisions a
virtualenv and execs the server.  The client pulls the scenario's mission (initial
pose + goal) via ``GetMission`` and pushes a single readiness flag via
``ReportReadiness``.

The heavy lifting -- localization init, routing, engage, and readiness
aggregation -- lives here on the Autoware side (see :mod:`.node`), driven through
the Autoware AD API.  The scenario framework stays free of any ROS 2 dependency.
